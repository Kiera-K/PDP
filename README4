## PROJECT 4

## 1. Overview:

This project provides a controller for the Dungeons game model. The model contains functionality 
to create a bespoke dungeon based on user inputs that are aceepted as command line arguments, 
for the creation of a player and to add arrows, treasure and otyughs in the dungeon. 
The dungeon is created using a specialized Kruskal's algorithm depending on whether the dungeon is wrapping on noo-wrapping.
The controller for the model allows the user to play the game by moving the player from the start location to the end location
while outputing the surroundings of the player at each step. The player can defend itself from the otyugh by shooting arrows.
It can also collect arrows and treasure whereever they may be present.

## 2. List of features:

The playGame() method is the main feature that will allow a user to play the game of moving the player across the dungeon from start to
end, collecting arrows and treasure and notifying the user of the players surroundings.

## 3. How to run:

Please run the jar file.
The order of the arguments are as follows : 
1) m : number of rows of the dungeon
2) n : number of columns of the dungeon
3) interconnectivity : interconnectivity of the dungeon
4) treasurePercentage : Percentage of caves that should have treasure.
5) monsterCount : The number of otyughs that should be present in the dungeon.
6) isWrapped : Whether the dungeon should be wrapping or not.

Example values : 4 6 6 20 3 y
     
## 4. How to use the program:

Run the jar file with arguments as mentioned above in the order => (m n interconnectivity treasurePercentage monsterCount, isWrapped).
It will create a dungeon object with the given arguments and allow the user to play via command line inputs.

## 5. Description of examples:

There are 2 example runs.

1) "PlayerEatenByOtyugh.txt" has a wrapping dungeon of size 4 x 6 comprising of caves and tunnels with interconnectivity of 6.
It has 8 monsters and treasurePercentage (which is the same for arrows as well) is 60.
This run depicts the player being eaten by an otyugh and losing the game.

2) "PlayerWon.txt" has a wrapping dungeon of size 4 x 6 comprising of caves and tunnels with interconnectivity of 6.
It has 3 monsters and treasurePercentage (which is the same for arrows as well) is 60.
It shows the player navigating through the dungeon, picking up arrows and treasure, killing an otyugh and reaching
the end of the dungeon and winning the game.

1. Information about System.in and System.out being used is printed along with the parameters used to initialize the
   game.
2. Player explores the dungeon.
3. Picks action from the ones available.
4. Picks up treasure.
5. Picks up arrows.
6. Kills Otyughs.
7. Gets Killed by Otyugh.
8. Wins game.
9. Loses game.
10. Quits game.

## 6. Design Changes:

1. Initially, I was checking for the monster health using integers. But then I changed that into an enum that 
would hold the healths of the monster : HEALTHY, INJURED, DEAD
2. Initially had an ordinary DFS method for arrow traversal. But then changed that into a specialized DFS that could take the arrow to the correct location.
3. Initially I was leaving the dead body of the monster in the cave. But then decided to delete the dead monster from the cave.

## 7. Assumptions:

1. After the Otyugh dies, it's dead body is removed from the cave.
2. The amount of treasure collected does not get converted into lives for the player as it might in a normal game.
3. There can be multiple arrows in a cave.
4. If arrows are found in a cave, and the user decides to pick, the player must pick all arrows and not just a specified number.
5. Similarly, if treasure is found, and the user decides to pick, the player must pick all the treasure instead of just a specific one like only ruby.
6. When a player escapes an injured monster by a probability of 50%, the player and the injured monster coexist in that cave.

## 8. Limitations:

1) The player health does not have levels and can take only 2 values : Alive or dead. (True or false)
2) There can be only 1 monster per cave.
3) There can be only 1 player per dungeon.
